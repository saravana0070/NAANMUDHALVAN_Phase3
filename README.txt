 Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project:

1. Data Loading
- The COVID-19 vaccine data should be stored in a CSV file named 'country_vaccinations.csv.'
- Use the following code to load the dataset:


  Python:
  import pandas as pd
  data = pd.read_csv('country_vaccinations.csv')
  

2. Data Preprocessing
- Duplicate records are removed from the dataset to ensure data cleanliness.
- Missing numerical values are filled with the mean of their respective columns.
- Ensure that the 'selected_features' list is customized to your analysis needs.

3. Feature Selection
- Choose relevant features for your analysis. Ensure that the selected columns exist in the dataset.
- The 'selected_features' list is customizable based on your project requirements.

 4. Encoding Categorical Variables
- Categorical variables are transformed into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
- Ensure that the 'categorical_feature' corresponds to the categorical variable in your dataset.

 5. Splitting Data
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Customize the data split ratios according to your project's needs.



 6. Feature Scaling
- Numerical features are scaled using the StandardScaler to ensure consistency and enable proper model training.
- Customize the features to be scaled based on your dataset.

 Conclusion:
The preprocessing steps outlined in this project ensure that the COVID-19 vaccine data is clean, relevant, and prepared for further analysis. These steps are vital for optimizing vaccine deployment strategies. The preprocessed data can now be used for machine learning model development and in-depth analysis to provide insights and recommendations for policymakers and health organizations.
